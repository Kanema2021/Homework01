# Homework01
For this project i had to consolidate many of the css classes as they had the same attributes. 
I made notes above the classes that I mades adjustments to.
I then changed the HTML elements to make them semantic, and ensured that they follow a logical structure independent of styling and poistioning. 
I added accessible alt attributes to all images and adusted the order of the heading attributes.
I placed all heading attributes in sequential order and added a concise, descriptive title.
Finally I checked all links were working properly.
